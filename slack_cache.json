Hope you all had a great weekend!  @ajavadov, as we continue to move forward on this project, @ntucakovic has pointed out/reminded me that we are only showing VH to cPanel customers with one website on their cPanel plan.  As time allows, can we discuss in this :thread: if it would make sense to show the cPanel plan on VH to all customers based on the Primary domain as a part of our phase 2, regardless of how many sites they have?  My thought is that since we will be showing a sites list on our settings page, it will at least provide a reference to the other sites.  Also, as  MYA currently only shows the accordion for the cPanel plan based on the primary domain, it would be a 1:1 experience between the 2. Love to hear your thoughts - thank you in advance!",

      "text": "Hey Team!\n\nIt looks like we made some great progress in regards to concerns with the cPanel api, and the associated latency - however during a walkthrough this morning, the PX engineering team noted that there still may be some concerns in regards to the Venture/cPanel connections, and how the logic works.\n\nHere's one example of an observation/customer path we replicated today (Recording attached below, start at 04:22)\n1. Purchased a new domain `<http://venturetrial22025.com|venturetrial22025.com>`\n2. Domain Purchased path forced use of WAM/AIRO coming soon page\n    a. This applies a WAM DNS template to the domain\n3. Purchased a cPanel account\n4. Provisioned cPanel account\n5. Attached domain `<http://venturetrial22025.com|venturetrial22025.com>` to web Hosting\n6. Confirmed in DNS manager that the cPanel DNS template was applied (A record was pointing to cPanel account)\n7. DNS had NOT publicly resolved immediately, due to propagation\n8. Visited my Products, Venture is still WAM\n9. As a customer likely would, followed primary actions to edit/use WAM\n10. WAM DNS template re-applied, once publish was used (not just on the editor, as we saw as a false-positive at ~07:45\n11.  As domain was already on cPanel, no way to \"re-attach\" to apply correct template\n12. Updated A record on domain to point to cPanel\n13. Confirmed DNS changes\n14. Noted that DNS publicly updated\n15. Venture is STILL WAM\n16. NOTE:  the rest of the video shows me desperately try to find a way to fix the issue as a customer - the old trick to delete/cancel the WAM trial from the subscriptions page is no longer visible in all cases due to recent changes from the renewals team. (Freemium products no longer show on this page)\nI rechecked multiple times throughout the day on Friday, and about 4 hours after the original attempts, the venture tile finally redirected to cPanel vs WAM.\n\nDespite the back and forth here, I think we need to come back together and determine how we can ensure that once a domain is attached to cPanel, the venture shows cPanel vs WAM.\n\n@ntucakovic believes he ran across additional use cases as he has an example account that continues to show WAM despite being on cpanel - however we cannot readily replicate his path.\n\nThere is a meeting set for Tuesday for our normal sync - if we have the right folks, I would like to discuss a path to dig into this once again, and find how we can align towards solutions etc - thanks!\n\n<https://secureservernet-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/mrichards_godaddy_com/ETlt5vpvvZRNl2O0BQZC2usBMcE3s_mEDX-OLnji2xGuYQ?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJTdHJlYW1XZWJBcHAiLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJTaGFyZURpYWxvZy1MaW5rIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXcifX0%3D&amp;e=J6i7rL|Meeting with mrichards-20250711_090033-Meeting Recording.mp4>",

The VH initiative focuses on improving the customer experience for users who have cPanel hosting plans. The goal of the initiative is to provide a seamless and user-friendly dashboard for customers to manage their hosting services.\n\nSome key points regarding the VH initiative include:\n1. The VH initiative aims to ensure that once a domain is attached to cPanel, the Venture Homes dashboard displays cPanel information instead of other services like WAM.\n2. There is ongoing work to integrate features like Site Optimizer into the VH dashboard, ensuring that only users included in specific experiments can access certain functionalities.\n3. The team is discussing strategies to show the cPanel plan on Venture Homes to all customers based on the primary domain, regardless of the number of sites they have.\n4. There have been discussions about maintaining a consistent user experience between Venture Homes and other platforms like MYA, especially in terms of displaying hosting information.\n\nOverall, the VH initiative at GoDaddy is focused on enhancing the hosting experience for customers with cPanel plans by providing a user-friendly and feature-rich dashboard.",

The main focus of the VH initiative is to enhance the customer experience for users with cPanel hosting plans. The goal is to provide a seamless and user-friendly dashboard for customers to manage their hosting services effectively.\n\nKey points about the VH initiative include:\n1. Ensuring that once a domain is connected to cPanel, the Venture Homes dashboard displays cPanel information instead of other services like WAM.\n2. Ongoing work to integrate features like Site Optimizer into the VH dashboard, restricting access to specific functionalities to users included in specific experiments.\n3. Discussions regarding displaying the cPanel plan on Venture Homes for all customers based on the primary domain, regardless of the number of sites they have.\n4. Emphasizing a consistent user experience between Venture Homes and other platforms like MYA, especially in terms of displaying hosting information.\n\nOverall, the VH initiative at GoDaddy is dedicated to improving the hosting experience for customers with cPanel plans by providing a user-friendly and feature-rich dashboard.",

      "text": "*Nikola Dimitrijevic*  [6:44 AM]\nHey all, I wanted to open up a thread here to discuss about changes coming to gateway which we have to follow through on our own frontend repos, in this specific case for hub. Change coming up is related to auth token TTL, it will be 12 hours and users will have to be redirected to SSO to login page (there is currently a bug on heartbeat team or sso team that will force users to relog even if they have checked \u201cStay signed in\u201d checkbox, but that\u2019s another topic), to follow this change through on our end we have to properly handle 401 errors on our frontend\u2019s side, as those 401 errors will be coming straight from gateway, they won\u2019t be reaching our APIs backend servers. There are a couple of implementation challenges how to handle this while ensuring reliable 401 redirects to SSO and maintaining code readability, and easier code maintenance:\nWe attempted to reuse the existing expired token redirection logic on shell, previously implemented by Hosting team <https://github.com/gdcorp-partners/hcx-spa-shell/pull/147/files|here>. However, it doesn\u2019t fully meet our needs because the redirection to SSO only occurs after a full page reload when the shell is called. This creates a problem where the token may expire, API calls start failing, but the user isn\u2019t redirected to sso until they manually reload the page. Not sure if it would be the similar situation on Hosting as well?\nPotential solutions we\u2019re considering:\n\u2022  Implement a Service Worker in the shell to intercept 401 responses and trigger a redirect to SSO. This is our preferred solution, but it requires additional investigation and testing effort to set up properly.\n\u2022  Override axios and fetch globally and enforce the use of these instances across all SPAs to handle 401 responses consistently.\nDo you have any suggestions or alternative ideas? This issue is affecting multiple teams and needs a global solution. (edited)",

Downside could be for the pages/flows that aren\u2019t persisting UI into url (like a modal modal where the error occurred not getting opened after reload or similar)\n\nI\u2019m just hoping there\u2019s some proprietary in-house package already that would resolve this elegantly for us that I\u2019m not aware of (edited)",

One thing I wanted to flag for further discussion \u2014 how do we envision handling `POST` or `PUT` requests that fail with a `401`, especially in flows that involve side effects (like form submissions or actions via buttons)?\nIf the Service Worker intercepts and redirects immediately, we risk losing request body context. Do we plan to differentiate handling between safe (GET) and unsafe (POST/PUT) methods in the short term?",

I think it\u2019s a fairly lower chance of errors popping up on a POST request vs GET request, just because of number of made GET vs POST.\n\nI\u2019m unsure how we could avoid losing context? It does sound super annoying for a long form to lose content because of a page reload (or for instance working out a client report in the Hub :sweat_smile:).\n\nHow about a warning modal that pops up once we detect a TTL issue? With a user action to do a reload (which will do  an SSO redirect) or dismiss a modal.\n\nThat way, user has a chance to copy whatever progress they made before having to reload the page and login?
